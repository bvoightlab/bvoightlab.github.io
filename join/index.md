### Postdoctoral Researchers

The Voight Lab welcomes applications for computational postdoctoral positions at the University of Pennsylvania. We have a range of human genetics data sets, populations genetics problems, and numerous opportunities for computationally-minded post-docs to sink their teeth into. See specific postings here:

[Computational Post-doc: Human Complex Trait Genomics](posts/PostDoc08_job_posting.pdf)

### PhD Graduate Students

Opportunities for rotations in my group are always available! Within the umbrella Biological Graduate Studies program here at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, I am affiliated with the graduate groups in:

- Genomics and Computation Biology 
- Genetics and Epigenetics [CAMB]
- Pharmacology

Our lab focuses generally on problems and topics in human genetics, but we are primary a computational lab focused on either data science efforts of methods development activities. Developing understanding of quantitative human genetics, programming, and statistics is our core foundation through which we ask questions and aim to tackle problems. We have foci in complex traits genetics, translational bioinformatics activities that take advantage of large-scale DNA biobanks, and also population genetics analyses and methods development activities. We're a small group, and you'll meet with everyone including me frequently. 

If you have not applied to Penn or have not joined one of the PhD programs above, the first step to joining our group is to apply to BGS and be admitted to one of these programs.

If you are already a PhD student at Penn and are interested in rotating in our lab, please [contact Ben]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact) to set up a time to discuss your interest. You can check out project interests and research areas on our website!

### Programmers

We are looking for programmers to bring new research products to practice around type 1 diabetes. Stay tuned for job postings shortly!


### Undergraduate Students

Undergraduate students are more than welcome to the lab!

Undergraduates can persue BIOL3990 or BIOL4990 directed research efforts, which have often resulted in many first author papers. The sky is the limit, and time is the only enemy to generating fundamental primary research effort. 

Interested undergraduates for research opportunities should [contact Ben]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact).
