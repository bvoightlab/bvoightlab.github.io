## Spider Genomics

Spiders are an amazing species, most notably for producing biomaterials that have some of the most unique and diverse biophysical properties of materials found in nature. Our previous work focused on the genomic assembly and silk-gene characterization of two species of spiders: the Golden-Orb weaver [_Trichonephila clavipes_]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichonephila_clavipes), one of the most well-studies arachnids for silk biology, and [_Caerostris darwini_]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin%27s_bark_spider), a species native to Madagascar infamous extremely tough draglines for the webs that it builds over the riverways there. 

We remain interested in characterizing these (and other) related spider species, as sequencing technologies develop and advance, for example, creating a more ‘complete’ Telomere-to-Telomere genome, collecting population genetic data to characterize demographic history, variation in mutation rates, and detecting signature of natural selection, or using advances sequencing technologies to characterize transcript expression in silk glands at single-cell and/or at spatial resolution.
