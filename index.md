Thanks for visiting our website! [Based at the University of Pennsylvania - Perelman School of Medicine](https://www.med.upenn.edu/), we are a computational, statistical human genomics lab interested in understanding the genetic basis of human disease, developing methods based in population genetics to understand the details of human evolutionary history and processes, and developing translation bioinformatics approaches to tackle problems in health systems.

## Highlights

{% capture text %}

Human genetics data is the starting point for virtual all our lines of inquiry, ranging from methods development to Big Data science focused on complex traits, population genomics, and translational bioinformatics. These data are often derived from public repositories, but we also are actively engaged with data collections generated from the [Million Veteran Program](https://www.mvp.va.gov/pwa/), among others.

Lab members develop their computational capabilities and put those skills to the limit towards their scientific pursuits. We are a diverse group with myriad interest, and there is a place for everyone and their interests. Methods we develop are all open source and freely available to the community.
