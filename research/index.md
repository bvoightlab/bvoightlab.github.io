<!-- start popgen unit -->
{% capture text %}

We are an active population genetics lab and projects focus around studies of mutation rate variation, natural selection, and projects at the interface between population genetics and complex traits. Projects include both methods development and/or data science analysis. We are especially interested in development and applications using _Baymer_, a tool to infer mutation rate variation based on local nucleotide sequence context that we recently reported. We're also active collaborators with other pop-gen minded groups at Penn!

<!-- start Complex Traits -->
{% capture text %}

We are interested in the architecture of complex traits, identification of causal genes, and inference of perturbations informed by human genetics predicted to be therapeutically actionable. Our phenotypic spaces of interest include cardiometabolic traits - most notably type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and liver disease - but we are generally interested in pleiotropy at large. We touch all layers, including GWAS, pheWAS, fine-mapping, variant-to-gene mapping, risk prediction via PRS, and collaborations to validate causal genes.

Causal inference is one of the most challenging - but important - problems in biology and medicine. As a human genetics lab, we are active in the application of  
_Mendelian Randomization_ as a statistical approach to provide one line of evidence on the causal inference problem. Available projects inclde Big Data analysis and potentially methods development (presuming that Stephen Burgess hasn't already crafted something!).

<!-- start Consortium units -->
{% capture text %}

My group is active in several consortia, generally focused around human genomics data. The objectives of these interactions are to either assemble data for discovery, collaborate to advance functional validation of causal genes for T2D, access to large-scale biobank data (e.g., MVP), or to develop new portals to aggregate data into a single knowledge portal.

We also have some exciting and crazy aspirations for other projects, looking for just the right person (and resourcing)!
