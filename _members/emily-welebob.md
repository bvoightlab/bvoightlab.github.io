Emily joined the lab in October of 2018 at a wet-lab technician to help press along a large-scale non-coding targetted resequencing project for T2D using samples from Penn Medicine Biobank. Unfortunately, Covid-19 hit in 2020 and the work had to be halted. Subsequently, she transitioned to develop her computational skills! In that capacity, she developed and executed pieplines to perform SNV calling from whole-genome sequencing data, as well as developing a pipeline for analysis of variation associated with change in gene expression over a 24 hour period.

In October 2021, Emily moved onto a position as a Bioinformatician in Aaron Haeusler's group at Jefferson University.
