Brandon is a genetics PhD candidate working on understanding how common genetic variants contribute to complex human traits, and joined the lab from Casey Brown's group in 2023. His work focused on mapping chromatin accessibility in primary liver tissue, as well as analyzing extant chromatin accessibility data to identify genetic variation associated with that molecular trait (i.e., caQTL mapping). Brandon has capabilities in the wet lab experience from generating data and performing downstream experiments at the bench, and dry lab experience by performing various bioinformatics processes, followed by the application of statistical analysis techniques in R, python, and bash environments. 

He leverages his skills and experiences as a life science consultant for large global pharmaceutical companies and most recently completed an internship as a computational biologist at GSK.

He defended in dissertation in 2025 and has accepted a post-doc position at Novartis.
