Kim joined the Voight lab as a postdoc in 2015 and after a few years decided to stay on as research staff. Prior to that, she went to Allegheny College for undergrad and did her Ph.D in Barak Cohen's lab at Washington University in St Louis, studying complex traits in wild yeast. Broadly, she is interested in understanding how genes interact to create complex phenotypes and these days attempts to figure that out in the model system of humans, mostly with a focus on type 2 diabetes and other cardiometabolic traits. 

Outside the lab, Kim owns a slightly worrying number of houseplants, reads a lot (mostly scifi/fantasy), enjoys spending time hanging out with her husband and son, gardening, and playing video games.
