Chris's work in the lab focused on using human genetics data for blood cell formation and function. He used genomics techniques to find non-coding regions, novel genes, and mechanisms that impact hematopoiesis. His projects utilized applied machine learning, genetic colocalization, and Mendelian randomization strategies to human genome-wide association studies and epigenetic data for this purpose.

In 2022, Chris started his own lab as an Assistant Professor of Pediatrics at Penn/CHOP!
