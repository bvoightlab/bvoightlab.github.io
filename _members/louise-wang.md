Louise connected with the lab in 2020, and her focus was on phenotyping of pancreatic cancer in the VA health system with subsequent effort to perform human genetic association studies and develop genetic risk prediction tools using those data in the Million Veteran Program. She very quickly earned a VA Career Development award in early 2022. 

Later in 2022, she took a position as an Assistant Professor of Medicine in the Section of Digestive Diseases at Yale School of Medicine and Staff Gastroenterologist at the VA Connecticut Healthcare system.
