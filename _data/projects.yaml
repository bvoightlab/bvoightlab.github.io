  description: The <em>Intgrated Haplotype Score</em> - A method to detect signals of extended haplotype homozygosity in genomic regions consistent with the action of recent, ongoing selective sweeps using population level data. Introduced in Voight and Kudaravalli et al (2006), adjustments for local, low recombination rates were presented Johnson and Voight (2018).

  description: A method to detect signals of an excess number of polymorphisms at near identifical frequency in very close physical proximity, consistent with the action of long-term balancing selection. Introduced in Siewert and Voight (2017), estimates of substitution rates were subsequently incorporated by Siewert and Voight (2020) as the β(2) statistic.

  description: <u>EV</u>aluating <u>I</u>BD <u>C</u>onsistency via <u>O</u>bligate <u>R</u>ecombination <u>D</u>istance - A method designed to detect the rare variants whose alleles are not mutually shared identically by decent, i.e., are IBD-inconsistent which can result from recurrent mutation, gene conversion, or genotype error. This method performs the Gibbs sampler for the Bayesian hierarchical model described by Johnson et al (2022).
